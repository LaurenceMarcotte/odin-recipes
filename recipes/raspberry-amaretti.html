    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These light chewy biscuits are perfect with coffee. They have a fresh raspberry hidden inside.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>butter, for greasing</li>
        <li>4 free-range egg whites</li>
        <li>340g caster sugar </li>
        <li>340g ground almonds </li>
        <li>18g freeze-dried raspberries, blitzed to a powder </li>
        <li>1 tsp almond extract </li>
        <li>18 small fresh raspberries </li>
        <li>200g icing sugar </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5 and line 2 large baking trays with baking paper. Grease them very lightly to allow the paper to stick to the tray.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until firm. Add the sugar and fold through gently using a spatula or metal spoon. Add the almonds, raspberry powder and almond extract and mix thoroughly until you have a smooth paste. </li>
        <li>Take a heaped tablespoon of mixture, about 40g/1½oz if you want to be precise, and shape it into a flat round disc. Wrap the disc around a fresh raspberry to form a ball shape, pinching it together underneath so that the raspberry is completely enclosed. The paste may crack a bit along the top, but don’t worry. </li>
        <li>Place the icing sugar in a large bowl, drop each biscuit ball into the icing sugar and roll around until fully and generously coated. Place seam-side down on the baking trays, making sure they are about 2cm/¾in apart, as they will spread a little during baking. </li>
        <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes until they are just lightly golden. Leave to cool on the tray for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool.</li>
    </ol>
